# Karp-Rabin Algorithm

An implementation of the Karp-Rabin algorithm in C++

This implementation found the substring "ab" in "Karp-Rubin Algorithm" using one clock cycle.

For reference, C++'s std::string::find algorithm took eight clock cycles for the same search.

Note that this does not mean this implementation is always faster - although I have not tested it, I can guarentee that C++'s implementation will scale better.
