# Markov

An implementation of Markov chains in Python.

As an example, here are some results of a third order Markov chain used on Apple's terms and conditions:

- Apple assumes no liability to you only in the Apple Music Products and that any other party and that neither the Licensor and its licensors who reserve all their rights in law and equity.
- You agree to comply with any part of the iTunes Service with your Account settings during the use of the corresponding number of episodes.
