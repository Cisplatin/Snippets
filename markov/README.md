# Markov

An implementation of Markov chains in Python.

This implementation can save learned knowledge, and its order can be adjusted.

I taught my own instance all of my Facebook conversations (both my messages and the messages sent to me). For example's sake, here are some of the better sentences it generated from that (using a second order chain):

- My pleasure... I just love helping people reach their highest potential of artsy.
- Obviously I'm upset because I don't have a dog.
- I just realized we've literally been having a terrible time in university which isn't fun for Jill.
